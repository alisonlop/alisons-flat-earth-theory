				  <h5>The Flat Earth Theory:
			     is a theory that promotes the idea that Earth has a shape of a plane or disk.</h5>
			</p>
     <h4>Ancient Cultures:</h4>
     There has been many cultures including the Ancient Greeks, that believed in the concept that the Earth is flat.
		  The Bronze Age, Iron Age civilization of the Near East, and the Indian also believed this.

     <h4>The Government:</h4>
     The government itself has created a website/ society called The Flat Earth society where it seems to be a website to suport
      the flat eathers. In reality, they debunk everything that the flat earthers say and make it unrelaiable. The government obviously
       doesn't want you to think that the Earth is flat.

      The United Nations is an international organization made up of 193 countries founded in 1945 and committed to maintain international peace
       and security; developing friendly relations among nations; promoting social progress, better living standards and human
        rights. The United Nations is very powerful and their decisions in regard of solving huge problems outrule any country.
        As seen above, the logo of the United Nations is a map of the earth layed flat.

        <h4>NASA:</h4>
        All the information about the Earth is givin to us by NASA which is controlled by the government. Most of the pictures given
				 to us of the Earth are not taken from a point far away in space, in reality, they go around the Earth with a satellite. Then they put all the pieces
				 together to form a picture of the Earth. As seen below, you can see how the satelite goes around the Earth taking a picture of Earth as it moves its
				 away around.
